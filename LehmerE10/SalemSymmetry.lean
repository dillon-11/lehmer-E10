# unimodularity and the reciprocal (Salem-pair) symmetry.
Two small facts, downstream of `main_theorem`, recording the structure of the Coxeter
element as an integer lattice automorphism:
* `coxeterE10_det_one` : the Coxeter element lies in `SL(10, ℤ)` — `det = 1`.  A product
  of the ten simple reflections (each `det = -1`) is unimodular, and its determinant is
  pinned by the charpoly identity to the constant coefficient of Lehmer's polynomial.
* `lehmerPolynomial_selfReciprocal` : Lehmer's polynomial is palindromic, `coeff i =
  coeff (10 - i)`.  This is the reciprocal / Salem-pair symmetry: the off-circle roots
  come in a pair `{μ, 1/μ}`, so the spectral radius `μ` (Lehmer's number) has its inverse
  as a conjugate.  Equivalently, the Coxeter element and its inverse share a charpoly.

/-- The E₁₀ Coxeter element is **unimodular**: `det = 1`, i.e. it lies in `SL(10, ℤ)`.
Proof: `det = (-1)^(card) · charpoly.coeff 0`; the charpoly is Lehmer's polynomial, whose
constant coefficient is `1`, and `card (Fin 10) = 10` is even. -/
