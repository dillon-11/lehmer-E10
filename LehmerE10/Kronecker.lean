# basic facts about Lehmer's polynomial `L`, and Kronecker's theorem.
Contents:
  • degree/monicity of `L` and the evaluation witnesses `L(1) = −1`, `L(−1) = 1`,
    `L(2) = 1291` (prime);
  • `kronecker_roots` — Kronecker's theorem (1857) in root form: every complex root
    of a monic integer polynomial, all of whose complex roots lie on the unit
    circle, is a root of unity.  Proved from Mathlib's
    `NumberField.Embeddings.pow_eq_one_of_norm_eq_one` applied inside the number
    field ℚ⟮z⟯.
  • `totient_le_of_lehmer_root` — a primitive k-th root of unity that is a root of
    `L` has φ(k) ≤ 10 (cyclotomic = minimal polynomial + degree bound).
No `sorry`; no axioms beyond `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`.

    non-squarefree `p`.) -/
