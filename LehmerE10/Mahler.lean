  Mahler.lean — the Mahler measure of Lehmer's polynomial, in Mathlib's own API.

  Mathlib now has the Mahler measure (`Polynomial.mahlerMeasure`, Jensen-formula definition,
  with `mahlerMeasure_eq_leadingCoeff_mul_prod_roots`), Kronecker's theorem in Mahler form,
  and Northcott's theorem.  This file connects the repository to that API:

  * `lehmer_mahlerMeasure` : `M(L) = μ` — the Mahler measure of Lehmer's polynomial is
    exactly the Salem root, computed (not estimated) from the root classification: eight
    roots on the unit circle contribute `1`, `ν = 1/μ` lies inside, and `μ` alone lies
    outside.
  * `one_lt_lehmer_mahlerMeasure`, `lehmer_mahlerMeasure_lt` : `1 < M(L) < 7/5`, from the
    interval `y₅ ∈ (2, 21/10)` already isolated by the trace-quintic sign changes.
  * `LehmerConjecture`, `LehmerMinimal` : Lehmer's 1933 question, *stated* in Mathlib's
    vocabulary (a hypothesis `Prop`, not claimed, not assumed): Mahler measures of integer
    polynomials do not accumulate at `1`; strongly, `L` attains the minimum.
    `lehmerConjecture_of_minimal` : the strong form implies the gap form, with the gap
    witnessed by `M(L)` itself — which is `> 1` by this file.
  * `coxeterE10_infinite_order` : the E₁₀ Coxeter element has infinite order in
    `GL(10, ℤ)`.  If `Cox^n = 1` then, since its characteristic polynomial `L` is
    irreducible, `L` would be the minimal polynomial and would divide `Xⁿ − 1`; but `μ` is
    a root of `L` with `μ > 1`, and every root of `Xⁿ − 1` has norm `1`.

  Together with `coxeterE8_*` facts (finite case) this locates E₁₀ precisely: the Coxeter
  series crosses from torsion (spectrum on the unit circle) to a Salem element exactly at
  rank 10, and the crossing value is Lehmer's number.

/-! ### Lehmer's question, stated in Mathlib's vocabulary.

Both are hypothesis `Prop`s: *stated*, never claimed, never assumed. -/

/-- **Lehmer's conjecture** (Lehmer 1933, gap form): Mahler measures of integer polynomials
do not accumulate at `1` — there is a uniform gap `c > 1` below which the only Mahler
measure is `1` itself. -/
def LehmerConjecture : Prop :=
  ∃ c : ℝ, 1 < c ∧ ∀ p : Polynomial ℤ,
    1 < (p.map (Int.castRingHom ℂ)).mahlerMeasure →
    c ≤ (p.map (Int.castRingHom ℂ)).mahlerMeasure

def LehmerMinimal : Prop :=
  ∀ p : Polynomial ℤ, 1 < (p.map (Int.castRingHom ℂ)).mahlerMeasure →
    LC.mahlerMeasure ≤ (p.map (Int.castRingHom ℂ)).mahlerMeasure

/-- The strong form implies the gap form, with the gap witnessed by `M(L)` itself —
legitimate because `M(L) > 1` is proven above. -/

/-! ### The Coxeter element has infinite order. -/

/-- **The E₁₀ Coxeter element has infinite order.**  If `Cox^n = 1`, then since its
characteristic polynomial is the irreducible `L`, the minimal polynomial is `L` and
divides `Xⁿ − 1`; evaluating at the Salem root `μ > 1` gives `μⁿ = 1`, impossible.

Contrast: the Coxeter element of a *finite* Weyl group has order `h` (the Coxeter number
— `30` for E₈); at E₁₀ the spectrum has left the unit circle and no power returns. -/
